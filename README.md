# Customer Support Agent Tutorial Episode 1

In this part of the tutorial we setup our python environment and created a streamlit frontend for our chatbot. 

To setup the python environment I did:

```bash
conda create -p ./.conda python=3.11
```

Then activated the environment with:
```bash
conda activate ./.conda
```

To run the frontend you can type:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_frontend.py
```

Happy Agent Building :D
